    This mod allows you to make requests of allied factions to send specific items to sell.

    Have you ever been bothered by the fact that other factions will make requests of you all the live-long day, but you can't do the same of them? Well be discouraged no more! With this mod you'll be able to request items from other surrounding colonies. Of course the price of the item you request will be marked up, and the farther the other faction's colony is from your colony you'll be paying a little more as well (delivery charges exist even on the Rim), but now you don't have to wait for a random item stash quest to get your atomosomaniatic hands on those precious anti-grain warheads!
    Be warned, though! If the caravan arrives at your colony and you don't have what you agreed to pay for the requested items, the other faction may not be so happy with your colonists...

    Huge thanks to the developer(s) of the EdB Prepare Carefully mod, whose code helped immensely in the creation of this mod.
